"""
Use this script for ideas:
	
 We like:
- Single Player (not built for, not built against)
- Procgen
- Tactical Combat/Not RealTime
- Tile-Based
- Top Down/Isometric 
- 3D Engine / 2D Sprites
- Fantasy, (No Time Limit)
- Building Base w/ Rewards from Dungeon

Result: Make a mystery dungeon game,

Inspirations: Zettai Hero Project, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, Izuna: Unemployed Ninja


Possible Longterm Directions?:
	- Single player story based, like ZHP and most existing Mystery Dungeon games.
	- Multi player based? It doesnt look like theres very many games like this from my searches.


playability things:
allow diagonal
move BEFORE act

if attacking an enemy, adjust to movement, e.g. if you're attacking down and the opponent moves from down to down left, follow them

do not allow cornering
