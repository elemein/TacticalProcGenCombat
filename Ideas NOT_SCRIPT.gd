"""
Use this script for ideas:
	
 We like:
- Single Player (not built for, not built against)
- Procgen
- Tactical Combat/Not RealTime
- Tile-Based
- Top Down/Isometric 
- 3D Engine / 2D Sprites
- Fantasy, (No Time Limit)
- Building Base w/ Rewards from Dungeon

Result: Make a mystery dungeon game,

Inspirations: Zettai Hero Project, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, Izuna: Unemployed Ninja


Possible Longterm Directions?:
	- Single player story based, like ZHP and most existing Mystery Dungeon games.
	- Multi player based? It doesnt look like theres very many games like this from my searches.
